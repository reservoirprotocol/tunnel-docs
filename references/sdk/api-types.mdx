The Relay SDK comes with built in API types to facilitate interacting with Relay APIs. The API types are useful for parsing API responses and determining what parameters an api accepts. Note that the types are exposed as part of the Relay SDK package, leaving where and how you use it up to you. There's no requirement for React, or anything else, except for Typescript. Below we'll dig into some examples:

```typescript
import { paths } from '@reservoir0x/relay-sdk'

const parameters: paths['/execute/call']['post']['requestBody']['content']['application/json'] = {
  ...
}
```

With the Typescript types imported you can easily discover what query parameters an api might allow or what response an api will return.
