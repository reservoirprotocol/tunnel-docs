<Note>The `call` sdk action works very similarly and allows you to perform any tx cross-chain</Note>

### Before executing a bridge

Before executing a bridge, you should verify that the user has enough balance on the Origin chain to cover the the full bridge amount + fees. Check out [fetching a quote](/references/sdk/fetching-a-quote#fetching-a-quote) for more details on calculating the fees.

### Executing a bridge

Use the sdk's `bridge` action to execute the bridge and automatically handle the execution of steps.

```typescript
import { getClient } from '@reservoir0x/relay-sdk'
import { useWalletClient } from 'wagmi'

const { data: wallet } = useWalletClient()

await getClient()?.actions.bridge({
  wallet,
  chainId: 1, // The chain id to bridge from
  toChainId: 7777777, // The chain id to bridge to
  value: '100000000000000000', // Amount in wei to bridge
  to, // A valid address to send the funds to
  onProgress: (steps, fees, currentStep, currentStepItem) => {
    console.log(steps, fees, currentStep, currentStepItem)
  }
})
```

All you have to do now is use the `onProgress` callback to 
update your UI with the current step and status. The `currentStep` has an `action` and `description` that can be helpful to display in your UI. Each `stepItem` also has an array of `txHashes` that you can use to link users to their transactions on a blockexplorer. 


Once all `stepsItems` have a `status` of `complete`, the bridge was completed successfully and you you can show a success screen in your UI. ✅
