### WagmiProviderNotFoundError: `useConfig` must be used within `WagmiProvider`
This issue is usually the result of multiple wagmi versions, make sure you only have 1 version of wagmi installed. You may also want to delete and reinstall your node modules and clear all caches.
### No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one
If you've set the QueryClientProvider with a QueryClient it could be that you have multiple versions of tanstack/react-query installed. Make sure to double check and reduce this to just a single version of the package. You may also want to delete and reinstall your node modules and clear all caches.
### The UI looks unstyled
Make sure you've imported the ui package styles:
```typescript
import '@reservoir0x/relay-kit-ui/styles.css'
```
If the issue persists make sure there's no reset css or other css file overriding the styles provided by the package.
### Incompatability
If you see an error message that looks like this:
```
The types of 'utils.adaptViemWallet' are incompatible between these types
```
It could be that multiple versions of peer dependencies are installed. Review your package lock file for duplicate dependencies.
